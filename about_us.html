        The History of IceShakess! Ice creams and milkshakes &#x1F368;&#x1F92D;
    </font>
    </p>
    <p>
        In 1953, L. Ndidi found an open field in Claremont which later later turned into IceShakess!!
    </p>
    <p>
        With her husband and their only daughter. 
        They started making handmade ice lollies with the taste and quality fit for a king 
        and priced affordably even to the a person living on the street, this was the recipe for successes to come.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the late 50's in was now well-known and there was a porpular demand for the ice creams and milkshakes by the local companies.
        In 1960, It was then a registered factories and companies where most of the well-known where buying from our company IceShakes &#x1F366;
    </p>
    <p>
        It was given the name IceShakess! by their daughter Lona, 
        she said she gave it that name because it accommodates both the name ice cream and milkshakes which is what their company does.
    </p>
    <p>
        To make our company grow we first had to look at the target audience. 
        We knew that once a child says, "Mommy, Daddy I want an ice cream &#x1F62D;&#x1F62D;&#x1F62D;"
        We're on a right path. &#x1F923;&#x1F923;&#x1F923; 
        We made sure that we give our best and our all as well still do so to deliver the best to all those twho support our business
        because they are the reason why we are where we are today and the reason why we sleep with ous stomachs full everyday.
